<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About

This project is to facilitate launching and operating a Radicle Seed Node via docker containers. The goal is to automate the process of planting a Radicle Seed node in a Docker supported environment - removing the manual process of setting up and hosting the seed node on your local or remote machine.


### Motivation and Context

Hosting a Radicle seed node on your local machine 24/7 would not be a good idea. For public repos there are some buene amigos seeders out there, but for private stuff you need your own seedinfg host. 

*Why not just use Github/Gitlab?*

Because Microsoft doesn't respect privacy. Gitlab and other centralized git services seem to enjoy building AI solutions, what do you think they train their models with?

So I created a container that can run a Radicle seed node anywhere in any environments.

## Features

* Turn key ready OCI compliant container
* Run locally, or elsewhere
* Shell script to set everything up
* Deployment tested on some PaaS
* An acceptance security posture
* Web server for Radicle brwoser UI and convenience
* A separate mount for repositories so that only git repos data gets backed up

Of course, nothing is perfect, but I will try to keep this up to date and fix issues right here.
If you've truly tried everything and still can't get this to work for you, try to reach out. Or raise an issue. But I make no promise

### Built With

- [docker](https://docker.com) - of course, but [you don't have to](https://opencontainers.org/).
- [radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) - that's beast

### Also using

- [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) - as reverse proxy. Because why not caddy.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- you need [Docker](https://docker.com) installed
- or [podman](https://podman.io) or something that can handle containers

### Set up and run locally

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/apply-creatures/radicle-seed-node.git
```

Navigate to the repo root's folder and build the container

1. Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t radicle-node .
```

If you don't want to cache the docker build, use this command

```bash
docker build --no-cache -t radicle-node-image .
```

2. Run the docker container

```bash
docker run -dp 8776:8776 radicle-node-container
```

### Deploy

Best is to deploy the thing somewhere. Here is how

#### Deploy on fly.io

**First time**

```bash
$ fly launch
```

**Redeploy**

```bash
$ fly deploy
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Write a Dockerfile.
- [x] Write a Shell Script for automating setups.
- [x] Test on local machine.
- [x] Deploy to a PaaS.
- [ ] Connect to deployed node from local machine.
- [ ] Safeguard the container from security concerns.

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".
Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!

1. fork the Project
2. create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/some-feature`)
3. commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`)
4. push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/some-feature`)
5. open a Pull Request

## Acknowledgments

It would never end. I've done this work not just off dozens of other people's open source work, but hundreds, thousands, or maybe millions.
